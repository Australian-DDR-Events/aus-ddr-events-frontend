## Getting started

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Yarn
- Parcel

### Yarn

Install Yarn with `npm install -g yarn`

### Parcel

Install Parcel with `yarn global add parcel-bundler`

### dotenv

The set up of `.env` file is required in order to configure Firebase.

### Running POC

To start, simple do

```
yarn start
```

## Tests

To run test

```
yarn test
```

## Troubleshooting

- Usually, when renaming occurs, Parcel gets quite confused. To resolve, just delete the `.cache` and `dist` folder.
